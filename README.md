## 📖 Overview

A **C++ Console Application** to manage a multilevel car parking facility. It handles vehicle arrival, departure, and billing calculation using file handling (`parking3.dat`) to persist records.

## ✨ Features

-   **Secure Login**: Password-protected access (Default password: `pass`).
-   **Vehicle Entry**: Records driver name, vehicle number, and duration.
-   **VIP Logic**: Different billing rates for VIP vs. regular customers.
-   **Billing**: Automatically calculates parking charges upon check-out.
-   **Persistence**: Saves records to a binary file, so data isn't lost on exit.

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Compile**:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o parking_system
    ```
2.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    ./parking_system
    ```
3.  **Login**: Enter `pass` when prompted.
4.  **Menu**: Use the number keys to select an option (Arrival, Departure, View Records, etc.).
